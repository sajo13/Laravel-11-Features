Handling Failed Jobs
Laravel automatically handles failed jobs if you have the failed_jobs table set up. To configure this, you need to run:


php artisan queue:failed-table

php artisan migrate
To handle the failure:


namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class SendWelcomeEmail implements ShouldQueue
{
    public function failed(Exception $exception)
    {
        Log::error('Failed to send email: ' . $exception->getMessage());
    }
}


You can view failed jobs by running:

php artisan queue:failed

To retry failed jobs:

php artisan queue:retry all
